### Tokimeki Unfollow
> ~KonMari your Twitter follows~

Do you think your feed sucks because you follow too many accounts? You're in the right place!

If you're like me, you've followed a bajillion accounts over your years on Twitter dot com. Some of them date back to your first days as an egg â€” when you were probably an entirely different human being. You have some socially-obliged follow-backs sprinkled among some thought leaders you've outgrown, but you've never found the energy to go through and clean up your follows.

Take a deep breath! Let's walk through our follows, one by one, and think about if each one still sparks joy, intrigue, inspiration, or is in any way still important to you. **If not, hit that Unfollow button!**

It's hard to do this all in one go, so don't feel bad if you need to take a break. I'll save your progress as you go so you can pick it up again another time.

      <h1>
        Hello, @{{ username }}! Let's konmari those {{followingcount}} accounts you're following ~_~
      </h1>
      <p>
        Do you think your feed sucks because you follow too many accounts?
        You're in the right place!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're like me, you've followed a bajillion accounts over your years on Twitter dot com.
        Some of them date back to your first days as an egg â€” when you were probably an entirely different human being.
        You have some socially-obliged follow-backs sprinkled among some thought leaders you've outgrown,
        but you've never found the energy to go through and clean up your follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a deep breath! Let's walk through our follows, one by one, and think about if each one still sparks joy, intrigue, inspiration,
        or is in any way still important to you. <b>If not, hit that Unfollow button!</b>
      </p>

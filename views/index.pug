      | Welcome to Tokimeki Unfollow~
    p.
      Do you think your feed sucks because you follow too many accounts?
      You're in the right place!
    p.
      If you're like me, you've followed a bajillion accounts over your years on Twitter dot com.
      Some of them date back to your first days as an egg â€” when you were probably an entirely different human being.
      You have some socially-obliged follow-backs sprinkled among some thought leaders you've outgrown,
      but you've never found the energy to go through and clean up your follows.
    p.
      Take a deep breath! Let's walk through our follows, one by one, and think about if each one still sparks joy, intrigue, inspiration,
      or is in any way still important to you. <b>If not, hit that Unfollow button!</b>
